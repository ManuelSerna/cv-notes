----------------------------------

- The file 'fourier_functions.py' contains all of my functions for all of the problems.
Each function has a commented description of what is expected as inputs and what is returned (if anything).


- The file 'my_plot_utils.py' contains plotting-related functions.


- The file 'test.py' is simply a driver Python script that imports 'driver_functions.py' as a module to test.

- I also have three images: one of a white rectangle, a white circle, and a butterfly.
